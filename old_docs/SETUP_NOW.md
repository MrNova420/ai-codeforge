# 🚀 ONE-COMMAND SETUP

## The Absolute Easiest Way to Get Started

Just run this ONE command:

```bash
./setup
```

That's it! The setup wizard will:

1. ✅ Install all dependencies automatically
2. ✅ Show you 20+ AI models to choose from (free and paid)
3. ✅ Let you easily assign models to each of your 23 agents
4. ✅ Configure everything perfectly
5. ✅ Get you ready to build in under 5 minutes

## What You'll See:

The wizard asks simple questions like:
- "Do you have an OpenAI API key?" (Yes/No)
- "Do you want free local models?" (Yes/No)
- "Choose your setup mode:" (Quick/Custom/Free)

Then it does EVERYTHING for you!

## Setup Modes:

### 1. Quick Setup (Recommended for Beginners)

- **Best for:** Getting started fast

### 2. Custom Setup (For Power Users)
- **Time:** 5-10 minutes
- **What it does:** Let you choose the exact model for each agent
- **Best for:** Optimizing for your needs

### 3. Free Setup (100% Free & Private)
- **Time:** 3 minutes
- **What it does:** Sets up local models only, no API keys needed
- **Best for:** Privacy, learning, no costs

python3 orchestrator.py
```

Choose Team or Solo mode and start building!

## Your 23 Agents:

Each agent has a unique personality and will respond differently:

**Planners/Designers (5):**
- Aurora - Big picture visionary
- Felix - Detail-oriented architect
- Sage - Research expert
- Ember - Creative designer
- Orion - Systems optimizer

**Critics/Judges (5):**
- Atlas - Brutal perfectionist
- Mira - Balanced analyst
- Vex - Provocative challenger
- Sol - Wise veteran
- Echo - Data-driven evaluator

**Developers (5):**
- Nova - Lead architect
- Quinn - Clean code artisan
- Blaze - Performance fanatic
- Ivy - Security specialist
- Zephyr - Integration wizard

**Developer Assistants (5):**
- Pixel, Script, Turbo, Sentinel, Link
- Each helps their paired developer

**Specialists (2):**
- Patch - Bug destroyer
- Pulse - Test master

**Overseer (1):**
- Helix - Team coordinator

## 20+ Models to Choose From:

### Paid (Best Quality):
- GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-3.5
- Gemini Pro, Gemini Ultra

### Free (Local, Private):
- CodeLlama 7B/13B/34B
- Llama 2 7B/13B/70B
- Mistral 7B
- Mixtral 8x7B
- DeepSeek Coder
- WizardCoder
- And 10+ more!

## Mix and Match:

You can assign different models to different agents!

Example:
- Helix (Overseer) → GPT-4 (needs best reasoning)
- Nova (Lead Dev) → GPT-4 (critical code decisions)
- Quinn (Code Review) → CodeLlama 13B (free, great at code)
- Aurora (Planning) → Gemini Pro (creative, free tier)
- Everyone else → Llama 2 7B (fast, free)

**Result:** Best quality where it matters, free where it doesn't!

## That's It!

Literally one command:

```bash
./setup
