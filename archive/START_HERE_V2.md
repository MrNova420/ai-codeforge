## 🤔 Which Version Should I Use?

### Use V2 (Recommended) ✨
```bash
./start_v2.sh
```

**V2 has everything V1 has PLUS:**
- ✅ Real multi-agent collaboration
- ✅ Persistent memory
- ✅ File operations

- ✅ Streaming responses
- ✅ Progress tracking

**Use V2 for:** New projects, complex tasks, learning, everything!

### Use V1 (If Needed)
```bash
./start.sh
# or
python3 orchestrator.py
```

**V1 is simpler but limited:**
- ✅ 23 agents with personalities
- ✅ 20+ AI models
- ✅ Solo and team modes
- ❌ No real collaboration
- ❌ No memory
- ❌ No file/code ops

**Use V1 for:** Simple chats, testing, backward compatibility
