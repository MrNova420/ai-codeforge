# 💬 Natural Language Interface - Just Talk!

**No code required! Just describe what you want in plain English.**

---

## 🚀 Super Easy Start

```bash
# Start chatting
./talk

# Or one-line commands
./talk "I need a login system for my website"
./talk "Create a REST API for user data"
./talk "Fix the bug where users can't log out"
```

**That's it!** No programming knowledge needed.

---

## 💡 How It Works

### 1. Just Describe What You Want

Instead of writing code like this:
```python
from flask import Flask, request
app = Flask(__name__)
# ... 50 more lines of code
```

**Just say this:**
> "I need a login system for my website"

**And CodeForge creates it for you!**

### 2. Natural Conversation

Talk to CodeForge like you're talking to a developer friend:

**You:** "I need a login system"
**CodeForge:** ✅ Creates complete authentication code

**You:** "Add tests for that"
**CodeForge:** 🧪 Generates comprehensive test suite

**You:** "Make it more secure"
**CodeForge:** 🔒 Adds security improvements

**You:** "Deploy it"
**CodeForge:** 🚀 Sets up deployment pipeline
